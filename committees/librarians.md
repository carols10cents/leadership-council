# Leadership Council Librarians

## Mission

The Leadership Council Librarians are tasked with recording output of the Leadership Council (meetings, decisions, policies, guides, documentation, etc.) as well as tracking and recording work items and the Council's backlog.

## Goals

* Ensure the Council can easily retain and access policies, decisions, discussions, etc. for future use including by future members.
* Make the output of the Council sufficiently accessible to the public to provide transparency and clarity to the Council's actions
* Make information about Project Policy and internal Council operations clear to anyone inside or outside the project.
* Make tooling available (in close collaboration with the infra team) for managing the tasks listed in [responsibilities](#delegated-responsibilities).

## Delegated Responsibilities

The Librarians are responsible for the following:

* Recording Project policies
* Recording and tracking Council internal operations.
* Recording operational decisions of the Council.
* Preservation of Council meeting minutes and other meeting artifacts.
* Maintaining a system for tracking work items and proposals including providing an accessible overview of the work items for the Council, Rust Project members, and for the wider community.
* Recording and tracking the existence and membership of Council Committees and other Council initiatives.
* Ensuring Council Member membership and affiliations are recorded.
* Tooling for tracking deadlines and time-sensitive things.

Where possible, all of these items should provide up-to-date tracking of changes over time.

The Librarians have the authority to make decisions over the tooling used for recording and tracking this information, with consultation with the Council.
Smaller internal tools that are used only by the Librarians do not require consultation.

## Duration

The duration of the Librarian Committee is intended to be indefinite, as long as the Council finds that having individuals assigned these tasks is useful.
Approximately every year, the Council should reevaluate and review the Librarian Committee's permit and performance.

For example, if all recording tasks are sufficiently automated or diffused among the entire Council, then the Librarian Committee may be retired.

## Contact, Communication, and Workspace

The Librarians primarily use general Leadership Council workspaces for communication and may be contacted through them:

- **GitHub Labels**: <https://github.com/rust-lang/leadership-council/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AC-Librarians>

## Process

Decisions about new systems and tooling are made by consensus of all Librarian members.

The process for how specific systems are managed should be recorded in this document as new decisions are made.
